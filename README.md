# MAX-3SAT-Genetic-Algorithm
Using a genetic algorithm to find the best possible solution to the Max3Sat problem. The files I used to test it out are included. It creates a random population of solutions and makes a cycle of crosssovers and mutations which leads to getting better solutions with each iteration.

More details about the problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAX-3SAT
